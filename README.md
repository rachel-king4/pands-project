## **Introduction** ##

The Iris dataset is one of the most well-known data sets in relation to pattern recognition.

It contains 3 classes, with each class referencing a type of iris plant. There are 50 instances of each class, with 150 instances in total.

Each class has 4 attributes, which are:

- Sepal length in centimetres
- Sepal width in centimetres
- Petal length in centimetres
- Petal width in centimetres

One class is linearly separable from the other two, while the latter are not linearly separable from each other.

## **My Analysis - what it entails, how Python is used to do it, how to run the Python code** ##

Performing exploratory data analysis means to ana;yse data using visual techniques. Python can be used to do this. It enables trends/patterns to be identified.
