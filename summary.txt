Sepal Length is the first variable we are going to summarise.
From the Histogram.png file, the top left histogram displays the number of occurrences for each sepal length.
The majority of sepal lengths fall in the 5.0-6.5 cm region.
There are few sepal lengths greater than 7.0cm.

From the scatter plot of sepal length vs sepal width, it is clear that the species "Iris-setosa" has the smallest sepal lengths of all the species.The species "Iris-virginica" has mostly larger sepal lengths, while the species "Iris-versicolor" falls somewhere in the middle.

A table of some Sepal Length statistics can be seen below:
+-----------------+--------+-------+-------+
|      Class      |   Mean |   Min |   Max |
+=================+========+=======+=======+
|   Iris-setosa   |  5.006 |   4.3 |   5.8 |
+-----------------+--------+-------+-------+
| Iris-versicolor |  5.936 |   4.9 |   7   |
+-----------------+--------+-------+-------+
| Iris-virginica  |  6.588 |   4.9 |   7.9 |
+-----------------+--------+-------+-------+
From the Sepal Length Statistics plot, we can see the range of data for min, max and mean for all three classes of Iris plants.
The line represents the mean for all three classes, while the shaded region represents the spread of data from minimum to maximum.
